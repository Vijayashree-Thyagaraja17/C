# Learning C
Learning the programming in traditional way

Hi Guys!

I am beginning my programming starting with C using the book by Brian W. Kernignham and Dennis M. Ritchie. Will update this readme as i learn new things!

First step is to download C Compiler. First lets understand what is a compiler. Compiler is a software which converts a code written in a langauge to machine readable format to process and give results. As we are using C, we stick to a C Compiler. I have used Dev C++ software to get the compiler for windows 10. The link to download this is https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/?source=typ_redirect

Install it with default settings. If you are using windows 10, dont install any of the previous versions as it did not work for me. After installing this versions, my code was able to run perfectly! Initially i created a simple hello world program in C as done by everyone to test if my compiler was working.
