# Learning C
Learning programming in traditional way!

Hi Guys!

I am beginning my programming starting with C using the book by Brian W. Kernignham and Dennis M. Ritchie.

First step is to download C Compiler. First lets understand what is a compiler. Compiler is a software which converts a code written in a langauge to machine readable format to process and give results. As we are using C, we stick to a C Compiler. I have used Dev C++ software to get the compiler for windows 10. The link to download this is https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/?source=typ_redirect

Install it with default settings. If you are using windows 10, do not install any of the previous versions as it did not work for me. After installing this versions, there was no issues

Lets start building the code!!
Firstly we begin with a simple program to say hello to the world of coding i.e the Hello world program.
A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.

We request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include.




To run the code, go to Execute Menu and click on Compile and Run. First lets understand why do we need to compile C program before running it. Our computer does not understand any language by itself. If we ran such code, then computer cannot understand anything and throws error. Hence always compile and run. The program written is merely a chunk of text for the CPU as it understands machine language. In order to convert your program into machine language you need to compile the code which is done by the Compiler.

Finally execute the first program. It is a great pleasure seeing the output as Hello World!!. But wait... Is this all we need? No!!
Computers have much more capabilities than this. Let us learn what other functionality does this language provide and how do we develop complex algorithms.

Will Keep updating until i get a hang of it!
